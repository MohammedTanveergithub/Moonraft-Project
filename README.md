# Moonraft-Project

Overview

This project aims to develop a fake image detection system that can distinguish between genuine and manipulated images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). With the increasing sophistication of GANs, detecting fake images has become challenging, and this system strives to provide a robust and accurate solution.

Dataset
<br>
Data Sources
<br>
The dataset used for this project consists of the following:

Real Images: Real images were sourced from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

Fake Images: Fake images were generated by applying a simple transformation (horizontal flip) to the real images. This is a simplified approach for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, a more diverse set of fake images generated by advanced GANs would be used.

Data Preprocessing

All images were normalized to have pixel values in the range [0, 1].
Data augmentation techniques such as shear, zoom, and horizontal flip were applied to the real images to increase dataset diversity.

Usage Guidelines
Data Preparation: Before training the model, run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory. These notebooks cover data preparation, model training, and evaluation steps. Adjust the dataset paths and hyperparameters as needed.

Training: To train the model, run the main.py script or use the provided Jupyter notebook (notebooks/model_training.ipynb). Make sure to set the correct paths to your data.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation.ipynb notebook or by running the main.py script with appropriate arguments.

Model Training

The model used for this project is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:
